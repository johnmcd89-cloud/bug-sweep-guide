# 11) Extra equipment (high-leverage additions)

Your current loadout is strong, but a few additions dramatically improve field results—especially for **localization** and for building a **network you control**.

## 11.1 Must-have (high ROI)

### Travel router

A travel router lets you:
- put your devices on a LAN you control
- inventory/diff hosts reliably
- isolate unknown hotel networks from your devices

### Monitor-mode capable Wi‑Fi adapter

Passive Wi‑Fi mapping is much better with reliable monitor mode. Many built-in adapters are limited.

### Directional antennas (2.4/5.8 GHz)

Directional antennas turn “RF is here” into “RF is over there.” Patch/Yagi antennas are the single biggest improvement for localization.

## 11.2 Strongly recommended (for real localization)

### Step attenuator

Prevents overload and helps you get close enough to pinpoint a transmitter.

### Near-field probe set

Near-field probes help determine which device/cable is actually emitting when you can legally inspect.

### SMA adapters + pigtails

Bring SMA/RP‑SMA adapters and short coax pigtails so you can connect whatever antenna you need.

## 11.3 Helpful optical/physical tools

- Strong flashlight
- Small inspection mirror
- Phone camera tricks (IR LED spotting in a darkened room)
- Compact borescope (optional)

## 11.4 Optional expansions

- USB BLE adapter (if you need better BLE stability/range)
- A known-good small tripod/clamp for repeatable antenna placement

## Philosophy

The goal is to reduce uncertainty:

- better directionality
- better dynamic range (attenuation)
- better isolation (travel router)
